			<h1>About the Band</h1>
			</br>
			<h2>Ah, the joy of humble beginnings…</h2>
			</br>
			<p>
				Metallica, one of the biggest selling acts in American history, were born on</br>
				October 28, 1981 when drummer Lars Ulrich and guitar player/singer James Hetfield</br>
				got together via Ulrich’s LA Recycler newspaper ad. Soon, the two had recruited Hetfield’s friend</br>
				and housemate Ron McGovney to play bass, Dave Mustaine to play lead guitar, and taken the</br>
				name Metallica after a suggestion from Bay Area metal scene friend Ron Quintana.</br>
				Their ascent was to be relatively quick, driven by sheer work-rate, effort and</br>
				a rare musical chemistry. After hitting the opener’s circuit in LA (where they supported the likes of Saxon)</br>
				they recorded their first ever demo No Life ‘Til Leather. The tape-trading circuit went crazy for it,</br>
				and after repeatedly well-received shows in the Bay Area, Metallica found themselves</br>
				relocating there after convincing bassist Cliff Burton to leave his band Trauma and replace McGovney.</br>
			</p>
			<p>
				East Coast metal merchant Jon Zazula pitched the band on an album deal with his indie label Megaforce</br>
				Records and 1983 found them traveling to New York in a stolen U-Haul to record their first album.</br>
				Shortly after arriving in New York in April 1983, Mustaine was replaced by Exodus shredder</br>
				Kirk Hammett and the boys hit the studio for the first time.</br>
				The resulting debut album, Kill ‘Em All, exploded onto the scene later that year brandishing punk-encrusted,</br>
				crunchy metal riffery, the likes of “The Four Horsemen,” “Whiplash” and “Seek and Destroy”</br>
				that were hailed as instant classics. The stellar reception in the metal community</br>
				allowed them to quickly make their second album Ride The Lightning with producer</br>
				Flemming Rassmussen in Copenhagen at Sweet Silence Studios during the summer of 1984.</br>
				With their writing chemistry maturing at an alarming rate of knots,</br>
				classic compositions such as “For Whom The Bell Tolls” and “Fade To Black” sat proudly</br>
				with the aggression of “Fight Fire With Fire” and “Creeping Death.”</br>
				Q Prime Management and Elektra Records both moved quickly to take the band on by the Fall of ’84,</br>
				and with the road getting busier and more international, the bands’ stature rapidly grew.</br>
			</p>
			<p>
				In late 1985, the Rassmussen/Sweet Silence combination provided the underpinning for Master Of Puppets,</br>
				the band’s third album, which was mixed in LA with Michael Wagener and released in March 1986.</br>
				“Battery,” the title track and epic instrumental “Orion” were among the astounding compositions,</br>
				and having secured a support slot with Ozzy Osbourne, Master of Puppets hit the top 30</br>
				album charts and expanded their fan base beyond comprehension. It was some ascent. Metallica appeared unstoppable.</br>
				But a heinous challenge was to be thrown at them when on September 27, 1986,</br>
				they suffered a tragedy beyond words. On tour in Sweden, during an overnight drive the bands'</br>
				tour bus skidded out of control and flipped, killing Cliff Burton. His influence on</br>
				the musical growth of the band had been enormous, combining the DIY philosophies</br>
				of jamming and experimenting with an acute knowledge of musical theory.</br>
				Faced with having to find a new path after 40+ auditions they tapped Jason Newsted from Flotsam</br>
				& Jetsam to take over bass duties. The quartet immediately jumped into a tour</br>
				and then quickly recorded an EP of cover tunes titled The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited</br>
				(the band literally did the dirty work in Ulrich's garage, which they helped</br>
				refit into a small studio space by hand themselves!).
			</p>
			<p>
				The band recorded their fourth full-length album, ...And Justice For All,</br>
				first with Rassmussen again taking the helm (this time at One On One Studios in LA)</br>
				after some initial work with Mike Clink (of Appetite for Destruction fame) didn’t work out.</br>
				Released in August 1988, the album reached #6 on the US charts,</br>
				while the band was busy blowing headliners Van Halen off the stage during</br>
				the Monsters Of Rock tour before embarking upon their first headline worldwide arena tour.</br>
				Metallica also made their very first music video for “One,” a dark,</br>
				monochromatic, violent, emotional piece which underscored Metallica’s thorough uniqueness.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then came stratospheric, explosive, cacophonous worldwide success.
